# sql-challenge

The sql to create the EmployeeDB database tables is located in EmployeeSQL and is called "EmployeeDB_Schemata.sql".

After importing the employee table, you run "Convert_dates.sql" to convert the dates into a usable format.

The SQL to run all the reports is in "SQL for Reports 1 to 8.sql".

I also did the bonus question and the jupyter notebook is located in the root sql-challenge folder, called "SQLBonus.ipynb".
